ICSI, or Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection, involves injecting a single sperm directly into an egg, increasing fertilization chances in cases of male infertility. It’s often used when sperm count, motility, or morphology is low, or after failed fertilization in previous IVF attempts. ICSI can significantly enhance the success rates of IVF by ensuring fertilization even with poor sperm quality. Trinity IVF Ahmedabad employs ICSI in appropriate cases, offering hope to couples with male-factor infertility. The procedure is safe and widely used, with good outcomes in many situations. Understanding how ICSI works and when it’s used can help you make informed decisions about your fertility treatment options.
